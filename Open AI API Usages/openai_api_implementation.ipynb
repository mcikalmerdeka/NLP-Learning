            "\n",
            "1. **Sleep Deprivation**: Consistently staying up late often leads to inadequate sleep duration, which can cause sleep deprivation. This can result in a range of problems such as fatigue, irritability, and difficulty concentrating.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Cognitive Impairment**: Lack of sufficient sleep affects cognitive functions like attention, alertness, concentration, reasoning, and problem-solving. This can impair your ability to learn efficiently and process information.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Mood Disorders**: Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. It may also exacerbate existing mental health issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Weakened Immune System**: Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining a healthy immune system. Insufficient sleep can weaken your immune response, making you more susceptible to infections and illnesses.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Increased Risk of Chronic Conditions**: Long-term sleep deprivation is associated with an increased risk of developing chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Hormonal Imbalance**: Sleep helps regulate various hormones in the body. Inadequate sleep can disrupt hormone production, including those that regulate stress (cortisol), hunger (ghrelin and leptin), and growth (growth hormone).\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Metabolic Effects**: Poor sleep patterns are linked to metabolic dysregulation that can lead to weight gain due to altered appetite regulation and decreased energy expenditure.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Reduced Physical Performance**: Athletes or individuals engaging in physical activities may experience diminished performance due to impaired muscle recovery and decreased endurance resulting from insufficient rest.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **Impact on Mental Health**: Staying up late frequently disrupts circadian rhythms which play a significant role in regulating mood through the balance of neurotransmitters like serotonin.\n",
            "\n",
            "10. **Decreased Productivity and Performance**: The cumulative effect of cognitive impairment and fatigue from staying up late often results in reduced productivity at work or school.\n",
            "\n",
            "To mitigate these effects, it's important for individuals to prioritize good sleep hygiene practices by setting regular bedtimes, creating a comfortable sleeping environment, limiting exposure to screens before bed, managing stress levels effectively throughout the day, and ensuring they get an adequate amount of high-quality restorative rest each night tailored towards their individual needs (typically 7-9 hours for adults).\n",

        "**How It Works:**  \n",
        "  - **Lower values (e.g., `0.1` or `0.2`)** → The model becomes more deterministic, meaning it will choose the most probable next token based on training data. This results in **more consistent, focused, and factual responses** but with less creativity or variation.  \n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Higher values (e.g., `1.5` or `2.0`)** → The model generates responses with more randomness, making it more creative and diverse but also potentially less coherent or relevant. It will take more risks in choosing words, leading to **more varied but sometimes inconsistent or off-topic responses**.  \n",

        "**General Recommendations:**  \n",
        "\n",

            "\n",
            "2. **Data Aggregation and Grouping:**\n",
            "   - Use group-by operations to aggregate sales data by region. This will help you compute total and average sales per region.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Time Series Analysis:**\n",
            "   - If your data spans a significant time period, analyze trends over time within each region to identify regions with consistent performance or growth trends.\n",

            "5. **Visualization:**\n",
            "   - Use bar charts or column charts to visually compare total or average sales across regions.\n",
            "   - Use line charts if analyzing trends over time.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Regression Analysis:**\n",

            "\n",

            "\n",
            "8. **Cluster Analysis:**\n",
            "   - Group regions into clusters based on similar sales patterns or characteristics. This can help identify distinct groups of high-performing regions.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **Benchmarking:**\n",

This will allow for quick visual identification of regions contributing most to sales and can be further drilled down by selecting specific products or time periods for more detailed insights.\n",

Different colors can be used for each product to compare how different age demographics are contributing to sales across various products. This can help in identifying which products are popular among specific age groups.\n",
