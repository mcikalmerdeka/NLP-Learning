How can i solve this error?

INFO:     127.0.0.1:59829 - "POST /generate?prompt=hello%20world HTTP/1.1" 422 Unprocessable Entity

this is the json in postman

{"detail":[{"type":"missing","loc":["body"],"msg":"Field required","input":null}]}


Ah, now I see the specific error - it's saying the request body is missing but required. This means your FastAPI endpoint is expecting data in the request body, not just as a URL parameter.

There are two ways to fix this:

1. If you want to send the prompt as a request body (recommended approach):
   - In Postman, go to the "Body" tab
   - Select "raw" and "JSON"
   - Send something like:
   ```json
   {
       "prompt": "hello world"
   }
   ```

2. Or if you want to keep using query parameters, you'll need to modify your FastAPI endpoint code.

Could you share your FastAPI endpoint code from `main.py`? It probably looks something like:
```python
@app.post("/generate")
async def generate(prompt: str = Body(...)):  # This is expecting a request body
```

Without seeing your endpoint code, I'd recommend trying the first approach - sending the prompt in the request body as JSON. Keep the method as POST, but move the data from the URL to the request body.
