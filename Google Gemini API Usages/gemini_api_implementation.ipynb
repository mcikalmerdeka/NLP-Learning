      "\n",
      "Here is a breakdown of the information presented in the table columns:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Main Sections:\n",
      "1.  **車両情報 (Vehicle Information):**\n",
      "    *   **Brand:** Lists the specific make, model, and year of the vehicle being analyzed (e.g., Toyota bZ4X 2023, Tesla Model Y Performance 2020, Lucid Air Dream Edition Performance 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **FRバンパ RF. (UPR) + FR CB. (UPR):**\n",
      "    *   This section likely refers to the combined data for the **Upper Front Bumper Reinforcement** and the **Upper Front Crash Box/Cross Beam**.\n",
      "    *   **部品点数 (Quantity of Parts):** The total number of components in this combined system.\n",
      "    *   **Total Weight (kg):** The total weight of these components.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **FRバンパ RF. (UPR) (Detailed Analysis):**\n",
      "    *   This section focuses specifically on the **Upper Front Bumper Reinforcement**.\n",
      "    *   **部品点数 (Quantity of Parts):** Number of parts for just the reinforcement.\n",
      "    *   **Total Weight (kg):** Weight of the reinforcement.\n",
      "    *   **Fastener(s) Weight (kg):** The weight of the bolts, screws, etc., used to attach the part.\n",
      "    *   **Width (mm), Height (mm), Depth (mm):** The physical dimensions of the reinforcement bar.\n",
      "    *   **Material Type(s):** The primary material of the component, such as `Metal > Steel` or `Metal > Alloy`.\n",
      "    *   **Material Type(s)/Plastics:** A more detailed material classification, showing specific types like **STEEL**, **ALUMINUM**, **NON FERROUS METAL**, or specific aluminum alloys like **AlSi1MgMn**.\n",
      "    *   **Manufacturer:** The company that produced the part (e.g., BMW, Renault, Lucid, HBPO, Constellium).\n",
      "    *   **備考 (Remarks/Notes):** Additional notes in Japanese. For example, `FR C/B(UPR)を含む` means \"Includes Upper Front Crash Box,\" clarifying what is included in the measurement.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Takeaways:\n",
      "*   **Purpose:** This is a professional benchmark analysis used by automotive engineers and designers to compare different manufacturing and design solutions for a critical safety component.\n",
      "*   **Focus:** The data highlights key engineering metrics like weight, dimensions, and material choice (e.g., steel vs. aluminum), which are crucial for vehicle performance, safety, and cost.\n",
      "*   **Content:** The spreadsheet allows for a direct comparison of how different manufacturers (from Tesla and Lucid to Volkswagen and Hyundai) approach the design and material selection for their front bumper systems.\n",
      "*   **Trends:** It reflects the industry's focus on lightweighting and advanced materials, especially in the context of EVs where managing weight is essential for maximizing range.\n"
